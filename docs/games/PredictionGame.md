## üß† Concept Overview

The **Live Game ‚Äì Prediction Mode** is a short-format, real-time prediction challenge that takes place on a **single match**.  
It is designed to simulate the thrill of a live betting experience **without monetary stakes**.  
Players earn points by correctly predicting the **final score** and answering a set of **contextual bonus questions**.

The mode can be used as a ‚Äúlive event‚Äù within a league, allowing all participants to compete during a specific match.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Game Rules

### 1. Game Creation
- Only **league admins** can create a Live Game.
- Admin selects:
  - One upcoming real-world match.
  - The game mode: **Prediction** (vs. Betting).
- Once created, the match appears in the league‚Äôs Live tab.

### 2. Player Flow

| Phase | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Setup (Pre-match)** | Player predicts the final score (e.g., 2‚Äì1). Based on this prediction, 4 contextual bonus questions are generated automatically. |
| **Kick-off** | Predictions lock automatically at match start. |
| **Live Phase** | A live leaderboard updates dynamically as goals are simulated or fetched from API data. |
| **Halftime Edit** | Players have one opportunity to adjust their final score prediction at halftime, incurring a -40% penalty on the final score points. Bonus questions cannot be changed. |
| **Results** | After the match ends, all scores are finalized and displayed in a results leaderboard. The admin can celebrate winners. |

## üßÆ Scoring System

A player‚Äôs **Total Points** =  
**Final Score Points (Max 60)** + **Bonus Questions (Max 40)** = **100 Points Total**

---

### ‚öΩ Final Score Points (Max 60)

| Criteria | Description | Max Points |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **1. Correct Result** | Correctly predicts the match outcome (win/draw/loss) | +15 |
| **2. Goal Difference Accuracy** | Based on the absolute difference between predicted and actual goal differences | 0‚Äì15 |
|  | `diffGD = 0 ‚Üí +15`<br>`diffGD = 1 ‚Üí +8`<br>`diffGD = 2 ‚Üí +4`<br>`diffGD ‚â• 3 ‚Üí +0` |  |
| **3. Per-Team Accuracy** | Evaluates accuracy of goals per team using `max(0, 15 - 4 √ó deltaTeams)` | +15 |
| **4. Exact Score Bonus** | If both scores are exactly correct | +15 |

**Halftime Malus:**  
If the player edits their score at halftime ‚Üí `FinalScore √ó 0.6` (‚Äì40% penalty).

---

### üéØ Bonus Questions (Max 40)

- Each match generates **4 contextual questions**, each worth **10 points**.  
- Questions are determined dynamically based on the player‚Äôs predicted score.

#### Example Logic:
| Predicted Score | Example Questions |
|------------------|--------------------|
| **0‚Äì0** | 1Ô∏è‚É£ Who will have higher possession?<br>2Ô∏è‚É£ Which team will get more shots on target?<br>3Ô∏è‚É£ Who will be named Man of the Match?<br>4Ô∏è‚É£ Which team will make more substitutions? |
| **Low-Scoring (<3 total goals)** | 1Ô∏è‚É£ Which team will score first?<br>2Ô∏è‚É£ In which half will the first goal occur?<br>3Ô∏è‚É£ Who will have the most shots on target?<br>4Ô∏è‚É£ Who will be Man of the Match? |
| **High-Scoring (‚â•3 total goals)** | 1Ô∏è‚É£ Which team opens the score?<br>2Ô∏è‚É£ Total goals in the first half?<br>3Ô∏è‚É£ Who scores last?<br>4Ô∏è‚É£ Who will have higher possession? |

Each correct answer = **+10 points**, incorrect = **0 points**.  
All questions share the same weight regardless of match prediction.

## üí∞ Points Summary Example

| Component | Description | Points |

## üß± Technical Architecture

| File / Component | Role |
|-------------------|------|
| **`useMockStore.ts`** | Central store managing game state, match progress, and player entries. Handles scoring logic and halftime edits. |
| **`liveGameEngine.ts`** | Contains the `calculateLiveGameScores()` function. Computes all scoring components. |
| **`LiveGameSetupPage.tsx`** | Handles pre-match prediction and bonus question display (now using centralized `generateBonusQuestions()` function). |
| **`LiveGamePlayPage.tsx`** | Displays live score simulation, dynamic leaderboard, and halftime edit logic. |
| **`LiveGameResultsPage.tsx`** | Shows final leaderboard and enables ‚ÄúCelebrate Winners‚Äù (admin-only). |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Backend & Mock Logic

- The game currently runs on **mock data** managed by Zustand.
- Live match progression is simulated by a scheduler (`tickLiveGame`) that updates match minute and score every few seconds.
- `calculateLiveGameScores()` recalculates player points on each render tick.
- Future API integration is prepared through `apiAdapter.ts`:
  - `fetchLiveOdds()` and `fetchFixtureStatus()` placeholders are ready for real-time data.

## üß© Edge Cases & Rules Enforcement

| Scenario | Expected Behavior |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Player edits score at halftime | Applies -40% penalty on final score component only |
| Player leaves game mid-match | Score persists; live updates continue |
| Player misses kickoff | Cannot submit or modify predictions |
| Multiple ties | Leaderboard uses tie-breaks by goal diff, then submission time |
| Match not finished | Leaderboard shows partial data until full-time |
| Match cancelled | Game ends with ‚ÄúNo Result‚Äù status; no points awarded |

---

## üéâ Celebrate Winners

At the end of the match:
- Admin can click **‚ÄúCelebrate Winners‚Äù** to generate a post in the league feed.  
- The post includes:
  - The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place players.
  - A short auto-generated message (editable by admin).
  - Visible date range for the leaderboard snapshot.
