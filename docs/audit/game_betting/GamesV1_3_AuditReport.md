# Audit Report: GamesV1.3 – UI Enhancements & Challenge Trigger

**Version:** 1.3  
**Date:** July 31, 2025  
**Auditor:** Dualite Alpha  
**Status:** 🟢 Fully Functional

---

## 🎯 Objective

This audit verifies the implementation of UI and logic enhancements from the GamesV1.2 audit. The focus is on three key areas:
1.  **Admin Manual Trigger** for starting challenges.
2.  **Ticket Wallet UI** for displaying expired tickets.
3.  **Challenge Cancellation UI** for clear user feedback.

---

## 🧠 Functional Summary

The GamesV1.3 update successfully addresses the UI and usability gaps identified previously. Administrators can now manually initiate the start or cancellation of a challenge from the admin panel. The ticket wallet has been enhanced to provide users with a clear distinction between active and expired tickets. Finally, tournaments that are canceled due to insufficient players are now clearly marked, and users are informed of their refunded entry.

## 1. Admin Challenge Trigger

-   **Status:** 🟢 Fully Functional
-   **File References:**
    -   `src/components/ChallengesAdmin.tsx`
    -   `src/pages/Admin.tsx`
    -   `src/store/useMockStore.ts` (function: `processChallengeStart`)

### ✅ Confirmed Behaviors:

-   A **"Start Challenge"** button is correctly rendered next to each "Upcoming" challenge in the `ChallengesAdmin` component.
-   The `onClick` event on this button is correctly wired to the `processChallengeStart(challengeId)` action in the Zustand store, via the `AdminPage`.
-   The `processChallengeStart` logic correctly evaluates the `minimum_players` condition:
    -   If `participants.length < minimum_players`, the challenge status is set to **"Cancelled"**, and the function returns a corresponding message.
    -   If the threshold is met, the status is set to **"Ongoing"**, and a success message is returned.
-   The refund logic within `processChallengeStart` is robust, correctly handling both coin-based and ticket-based entries by updating the `allUsers` and `userTickets` state arrays.
-   The `AdminPage` correctly uses the `addToast` function to display the success or cancellation message returned from the store action, providing immediate feedback to the admin.

## 2. Ticket Wallet Enhancements (Expired Section)

-   **Status:** 🟢 Fully Functional
-   **File References:**
    -   `src/components/TicketWalletModal.tsx`
    -   `src/store/useMockStore.ts` (function: `joinChallenge`)

### ✅ Confirmed Behaviors:

-   The `TicketWalletModal.tsx` component now correctly filters tickets into two distinct groups: **Active** and **Expired**.
-   Expired tickets are rendered in a separate section with a grayed-out design (`opacity-60`) and display the precise expiration date (e.g., "Expired on: DD/MM/YYYY").
-   The logic correctly implements the **7-day visibility rule** for expired tickets, ensuring they are hidden from the UI after this period.
-   A placeholder message ("No expired tickets.") is correctly displayed if the user has no expired tickets within the 7-day window.
-   The core `joinChallenge` function in the store continues to correctly filter out expired tickets, preventing them from being used for entry.

## 3. Challenge Cancellation UI

-   **Status:** 🟢 Fully Functional
-   **File References:**
    -   `src/components/GameCard.tsx`
    -   `src/pages/GamesListPage.tsx`

### ✅ Confirmed Behaviors:

-   The `GameCard.tsx` component now includes logic to check for `challenge.status === "Cancelled"`.
-   When a challenge is canceled, the card correctly displays:
    -   A prominent red **"Cancelled"** badge.
    -   A subtext stating, **"Your entry has been refunded."**
    -   The main action button container is hidden, preventing any further interaction.
-   The `GamesListPage.tsx` correctly categorizes "Cancelled" challenges under the "Past Challenges" tab, ensuring they are separated from active games.

---

## 4. Regression Checks

-   **Status:** ✅ Passed

-   **Daily Streaks & Ticket Capacity:** The logic in `processDailyStreak` for awarding rewards and checking ticket capacity limits remains intact and functional.
-   **Access Conditions:** The validation checks for `requires_subscription`, `minimum_level`, and `required_badges` in `joinChallenge` are still correctly enforced before any payment logic is executed.
-   **Dual-Entry System:** The flow for choosing between coins and tickets via the `ChooseEntryMethodModal` is unaffected and works as expected.
-   **Dynamic Pricing:** The automatic calculation of entry costs based on tournament tier and duration remains functional in the mock data setup.

---

## 💡 Recommendations

-   **Admin Panel Enhancement:** The admin panel form for creating challenges is currently missing. Re-implementing this form to allow admins to configure the new dynamic pricing, player limits, and access conditions is the next logical step to make the system fully self-service.
-   **Real-time Updates:** For a production environment, the cancellation and start statuses should be pushed to clients via a real-time service (like Supabase Realtime) to ensure all users see updates instantly without needing to refresh.

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

The **GamesV1.3** update is **Fully Functional**. All specified UI enhancements and the admin challenge trigger have been implemented correctly and are well-integrated with the existing backend logic. The system is now more robust, user-friendly, and provides clear feedback for all tournament states. No regressions were detected in core game systems.
