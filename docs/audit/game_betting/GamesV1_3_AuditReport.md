---

## 🎯 Audit Objective

This audit verifies the implementation of the UI and logic enhancements introduced in version 1.3 of the Games system. The primary focus is on the manual challenge start trigger for admins, the improved visibility of expired tickets, and the clear display of cancelled challenges.

## ✅ Confirmed Functional Elements

### 1. Admin Manual Trigger (Start Challenge Button)
- **Status:** 🟢 **Fully Functional**
- **Findings:**
  - The "Start Challenge" button is correctly displayed in `ChallengesAdmin.tsx` next to each tournament with a status of `Upcoming`.
  - Clicking the button successfully calls the `processChallengeStart(challengeId)` action from the `useMockStore`.
  - **Scenario 1 (Threshold Met):** If `participants.length >= minimum_players`, the challenge status correctly updates to `Active`, and the toast notification "Challenge successfully started" is displayed.
  - **Scenario 2 (Threshold Not Met):** If `participants.length < minimum_players`, the challenge status correctly updates to `Cancelled`. The refund logic for both coins and tickets is triggered, and the toast "Challenge canceled — not enough players. Refunds issued" is displayed.
  - The UI on both the admin and user sides updates in real-time to reflect the new challenge status.

### 2. Ticket Wallet Enhancements (Expired Section)
- **Status:** 🟢 **Fully Functional**
- **Findings:**
  - The `TicketWalletModal.tsx` component now correctly groups tickets into "Active Tickets" and "Expired Tickets".
  - Expired tickets are visually distinct (grayed-out) and display the expiration date in the format "Expired on: DD/MM/YYYY".
  - The logic to hide expired tickets after 7 days is implemented within the component's filter, ensuring the UI remains clean.
  - The `joinChallenge` function correctly filters out expired tickets, preventing them from being used.
  - A placeholder message "No expired tickets" is shown when the list is empty.

### 3. Challenge Cancellation UI
- **Status:** 🟢 **Fully Functional**
- **Findings:**
  - The `GameCard.tsx` component now correctly displays a red "Cancelled" badge for challenges with `status: "Cancelled"`.
  - A subtext "Your entry has been refunded" is also visible, providing clear user feedback.
  - The "Join" button is disabled for cancelled challenges.
  - The main `GamesListPage.tsx` correctly filters cancelled challenges into the "Past Challenges" section.

## ⚠️ Partial or Inconsistent Logic

- **None identified.** The implemented features are consistent with the requirements.

---

## ❌ Missing or Broken Behaviors

- **None identified.** All specified features for v1.3 have been implemented and are functional.

---

## 💡 Recommendations & Next Steps

- **Real-time Admin Updates:** While the UI updates on user action, consider implementing a WebSocket or polling mechanism for a future version where multiple admins could be active simultaneously. This is a low-priority enhancement for the current mock setup.
- **Ticket Auto-Purge:** The current logic for hiding expired tickets older than 7 days is handled on the client-side. For a production environment, a backend cron job should be implemented to permanently purge these records from the database.

## 🏁 Conclusion

The GamesV1.3 update successfully addresses the UI and usability gaps from the previous version. The admin trigger, ticket wallet, and cancellation display are all fully functional and integrated correctly with the existing state management. The system is stable, and no regressions were detected in core functionalities like daily streaks, access conditions, or the dual-entry system.

**Overall Status:** 🟢 **Fully Functional**
