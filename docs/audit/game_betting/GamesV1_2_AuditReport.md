# Audit Report: GamesV1.2 ‚Äì Ticket Expiry & Minimum Player Enforcement

**Version:** 1.2  
**Date:** July 31, 2025  
**Auditor:** Dualite Alpha  
**Status:** üü° **Partially Functional**

---

## 1. Summary of Findings

This audit verifies the implementation of two key features from the GamesV1.2 update: the Ticket Expiry & Capacity system (Takeruki Rules) and the Minimum Player Enforcement logic for tournaments.

The implementation is **partially functional**. While the core logic for both systems has been added to the data store, several UI components and trigger points are missing, preventing the features from being fully operational and verifiable from the user's perspective.

## 2. Ticket Expiry & Capacity (Takeruki Rules)

### Status: üü° Partially Functional

#### ‚úÖ Confirmed Functional Elements
- **Configuration:** The `TICKET_RULES` constant is correctly defined in `src/config/constants.ts`, establishing the `max_quantity` and `expiry_days` for each ticket tier.
- **Ticket Creation:** The `UserTicket` type in `src/types/index.ts` has been updated to include a `created_at` timestamp, which is necessary for calculating expiry.
- **Capacity Check Logic:** The `processDailyStreak` function in `useMockStore.ts` now correctly checks if a user has reached their ticket capacity before attempting to grant a new one. It successfully prevents the addition of a new ticket if the limit is reached.
- **Expiry Check Logic:** The `joinChallenge` function now filters out expired tickets by comparing `ticket.expires_at` with the current date, ensuring only valid tickets can be used for entry.

#### ‚ùå Missing or Broken Behaviors
- **UI for Expired Tickets:** The `TicketWalletModal.tsx` component has **not** been updated to distinguish between active and expired tickets. All tickets are rendered in the same way, and there is no "Expired Tickets" section. Users have no visibility into which of their tickets have expired.
- **Expiry Countdown:** The ticket wallet does not display the remaining time before a ticket expires, which was a key requirement for user visibility.
- **Auto-Purge Logic:** There is no client-side or simulated backend logic to remove tickets that expired more than 7 days ago. They remain in the user's ticket list indefinitely.

## 3. Minimum Player Enforcement

### Status: üü° Partially Functional

#### ‚úÖ Confirmed Functional Elements
- **Core Logic:** The `processChallengeStart(challengeId)` action has been correctly implemented in `useMockStore.ts`. It accurately checks if the number of participants meets the `minimum_players` requirement.
- **Cancellation & Refund:** If the threshold is not met, the function correctly updates the challenge status to `"Cancelled"` and performs the refund logic. It properly returns coins to the user's balance and resets `is_used` to `false` for consumed tickets.

#### ‚ùå Missing or Broken Behaviors
- **Admin Trigger:** There is **no UI element** in `ChallengesAdmin.tsx` or `AdminPage.tsx` for an admin to manually trigger `processChallengeStart`. The function exists but cannot be called from the frontend, making it impossible to test the start/cancellation flow.
- **UI for Cancelled Challenges:** The `GameCard.tsx` component has **not** been updated to display a "Cancelled" status. Canceled challenges are likely to appear in the "Finished" list without any special visual distinction, which could confuse users. There is no "Your entry has been refunded" message.

## 4. Regression Checks

- **Daily Streaks:** ‚úÖ **Functional.** The logic remains intact and correctly interfaces with the new ticket capacity check.
- **Access Conditions:** ‚úÖ **Functional.** All access conditions (subscription, level, badges) are still checked correctly before the ticket/coin entry logic.
- **Dynamic Pricing:** ‚úÖ **Functional.** The pricing matrix and admin override functionality are unaffected.
- **Dual-Entry Flow:** ‚úÖ **Functional.** The system correctly prompts the user to choose between tickets and coins when both are available.

## 5. Recommendations

1. **Implement Admin Trigger:** Add a "Start Challenge" button to the `ChallengesAdmin.tsx` component to allow manual triggering of the `processChallengeStart` function. This is critical for testing and managing tournaments.
2. **Update Ticket Wallet UI:** Refactor `TicketWalletModal.tsx` to create separate "Active" and "Expired" sections. Display expiry countdowns for active tickets and "Expired on" dates for expired ones.
3. **Implement Cancellation UI:** Modify `GameCard.tsx` to add a distinct visual style for challenges with a `Cancelled` status, including a badge and a refund notification message.
4. **Filter Cancelled Games:** Ensure that `GamesListPage.tsx` correctly categorizes "Cancelled" games into the "Past Challenges" section.

## 6. Conclusion

The `GamesV1.2` update successfully introduced the core backend logic for ticket management and minimum player enforcement in the data store. However, the implementation is incomplete as the necessary UI components and admin triggers were not created.

Because the features cannot be fully tested or utilized by a user or admin, the overall status is **Partially Functional**. The next development cycle must focus on building the frontend components to surface this new logic.
