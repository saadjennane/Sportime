# Audit Report: Rewards Configurator v1.5

**Date:** July 31, 2025  
**Scope:** Verification of Persistent Reward Lines, Smart Range Creation, and Admin Power-Up features.

---

## ✅ Confirmed Functional Elements

The audit confirms that the majority of the v1.5 features have been successfully implemented and are working as intended.

1.  **Tier & Format Auto-Detection**:
    - **Status:** 🟢 **Fully Functional**
    - **Finding:** The `RewardsConfigurator.tsx` component correctly receives the `tier` and `format` props from the `GameCreationForm.tsx`. A `useEffect` hook inside the configurator successfully triggers a reset to the appropriate base pack from `src/config/rewardPacks.ts` whenever these props change.

2.  **Persistent Reward Lines**:
    - **Status:** 🟢 **Fully Functional**
    - **Finding:** The component now uses an internal `rewardLines` state. The UI iterates over this state, ensuring all rank/range lines from the base pack are always visible. The "Clear Line" (`🧹`) button correctly empties a line's `rewards` array without removing the line itself, which matches the required behavior.

3.  **Drag-and-Drop Reordering**:
    - **Status:** 🟢 **Fully Functional**
    - **Finding:** The `@dnd-kit/core` and `@dnd-kit/sortable` libraries are correctly integrated. Each reward line has a drag handle, and the `handleDragEnd` function successfully reorders the `rewardLines` array in the component's state. The UI updates instantly and correctly.

4.  **"Save as Base Pack" & "Reset to Base"**:
    - **Status:** 🟢 **Fully Functional**
    - **Finding:** The "Reset to Base" button correctly reloads the default pack from `BASE_REWARD_PACKS`. The "Save as Base Pack" button successfully triggers the `updateBasePack` action in `useMockStore.ts`, which updates the reward matrix in the store's state, allowing admins to redefine defaults at runtime.

5.  **Line-Level Reward Management**:
    - **Status:** 🟢 **Fully Functional**
    - **Finding:** All actions within each reward line (`➕ Add Reward`, `✏️ Edit Reward`, `❌ Remove Reward`) are correctly wired. They open the `AddRewardModal` and successfully update the `rewards` array for that specific line.

---

## ⚠️ Partially Implemented

1.  **Smart Range Creation**:
    - **Status:** 🟡 **Partially Functional**
    - **Finding:** The "Add Range / Percent" button correctly opens the `AddRewardLineModal.tsx`, which allows for the creation of new `rank`, `range`, or `percent` lines. The new line is successfully added to the `rewardLines` state.
    - **Discrepancy:** The system currently **lacks validation to prevent overlapping ranges**. An admin can create a "4-10" range and then a "6-12" range, which would cause logical conflicts in reward distribution.

---

## ❌ Missing or Incorrect Implementations

- No features were found to be completely missing or incorrectly implemented from the core v1.5 prompt. The primary issue is the partial implementation of the Smart Range validation.

## 💡 Recommendations

1.  **Implement Range Validation**:
    - **File:** `src/components/admin/AddRewardLineModal.tsx` or `src/components/admin/RewardsConfigurator.tsx`.
    - **Suggestion:** Before adding a new line in the `handleAddNewLine` function, add logic to check if the new `start` and `end` values overlap with any existing lines in the `rewardLines` array. If an overlap is detected, disable the "Save" button in the modal and show an inline error message (e.g., "This range overlaps with an existing line.").

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

**Overall Status:** 🟡 **Partially Functional**

The Rewards Configurator v1.5 is a significant improvement and is nearly feature-complete. The core architecture for persistent lines, auto-population, and admin power-up features is stable and well-implemented.

The system's status is marked as "Partially Functional" solely because the "Smart Range" creation is not yet fully "smart"—it lacks the critical validation to prevent overlapping ranges. Once this validation is added, the feature can be considered fully functional and MVP-complete.
