**Audit Date:** 2025-07-31  
**Auditor:** Dualite Alpha  
**Version:** 2.0

### 1. Functional Summary

This audit confirms the successful implementation of the new **gross gain scoring system** for the Challenge Betting Mode. The previous profit-based model has been completely replaced. The user flow remains unchanged: players join a challenge, allocate a starting balance across various matches, and are ranked based on the points accumulated from their winning bets.

- **Status:** ✅ Fully Functional

---

### 2. Architecture & Scoring Logic

The core scoring logic, located in `calculateChallengePoints` within `ChallengeRoomPage.tsx` and `LeaderboardPage.tsx`, has been updated.

- **Winning Bet Calculation:** The formula is now `gain = bet_amount * odds`. The previous `- bet_amount` (profit) calculation has been removed.
- **Losing Bet:** A losing bet correctly results in **0 points**. There is no deduction from the total score.
- **Negative Scores:** The system now prevents negative total scores, with one exception: the `-200` point penalty for a lost `x3` booster is correctly maintained.
- **UI Display:** The `ChallengeBetController` now displays "Potential Gain" instead of "Potential Profit", and the calculation reflects the gross gain.

- **Status:** ✅ Fully Functional

---

### 3. Booster & Balance Handling

- **Boosters:**
  - **x2 Booster:** Correctly doubles the gross gain of a winning bet.
  - **x3 Booster:** Correctly triples the gross gain of a winning bet.
  - **x3 Penalty:** Correctly applies a `-200` point penalty if the boosted bet is lost. This is the only intended source of a negative score change.
- **Unspent Balance:** Unspent daily challenge coins are correctly discarded at the end of the day with no penalty or impact on the final score.

- **Status:** ✅ Fully Functional

---

### 4. Leaderboard & UI

- **Ranking:** The leaderboard correctly ranks players based on the new total gross points accumulated.
- **UI Terminology:** All user-facing labels related to scoring now use "Points" or "Gain", successfully removing "Profit".

- **Status:** ✅ Fully Functional

---

### 5. Conclusion

The Challenge Betting Mode has been successfully updated to a gross gain scoring system. The implementation is consistent across all relevant components, from the core calculation engine to the frontend display. The system is stable, free of negative scoring loops (aside from the intentional x3 penalty), and aligns with the specified design.

**Overall Status:** ✅ **Fully Functional & MVP-Complete**
