**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** July 31, 2025  
**Author:** Dualite Alpha  
**Status:** ✅ Partially Implemented

## 1. Functional Summary

This audit covers the interconnected systems that define the SportTime game ecosystem: tournament structure, the ticket-based economy, access conditions for exclusive games, and the player's economic loop (coin balance and daily streaks). The goal is to verify if these systems work in harmony to create a cohesive and engaging user progression path.

- **Tournaments:** Can be created with different tiers, durations, and entry costs.
- **Tickets:** Act as free passes to tournaments, earned through gameplay.
- **Access Conditions:** Gate high-tier tournaments behind player achievements (level, badges) or subscriptions.
- **Economy:** Players start with a base coin balance, which they can grow through daily streak rewards and use to enter tournaments.

## 2. Architecture Overview

- **`src/types/index.ts`**: Defines the data structures for `BettingChallenge`, `UserTicket`, `UserStreak`, and `Profile`, including new fields like `tournament_type`, `minimum_level`, and `is_subscriber`.
- **`src/config/constants.ts`**: Centralizes configuration for tournament costs, ticket limits, streak rewards, and betting limits.
- **`src/store/useMockStore.ts`**: The Zustand store holds the state for all game entities. Key new actions include `joinChallenge` (handling dual entry) and `processDailyStreak`.
- **`src/components/ChallengesAdmin.tsx`**: The admin UI for creating and configuring all tournament parameters.
- **`src/components/GameCard.tsx`**: The UI card for each game, which now displays tournament tier and dynamically adjusts its "Join" button based on user eligibility.
- **`src/components/Header.tsx` & `TicketWalletModal.tsx`**: Display the user's ticket balance and provide a detailed view of their available tickets.
- **`src/pages/ProfilePage.tsx`**: Displays the user's daily streak progress and max bet limit.

## 3. Tournament & Ticket System

### Game Structure & Types
- **Status:** ✅ **Fully Functional**
- **Findings:** The 3-tier (`Rookie`, `Pro`, `Elite`) and 3-duration (`daily`, `mini`, `season`) system is correctly implemented. The dynamic pricing matrix in `TOURNAMENT_COSTS` is used by the `ChallengesAdmin` form to automatically calculate `entryCost`. The option to manually override the cost is also present. Player limit fields (`minimum_players`, `maximum_players`) are included in the data model and the admin form.

### Ticket System & Dual Entry
- **Status:** ✅ **Fully Functional**
- **Findings:** The `UserTicket` type and mock data are correctly structured. The `Header` component now displays the total count of valid tickets, and clicking it opens the `TicketWalletModal`. The `joinChallenge` action in the store correctly prioritizes using a valid ticket over coins. When both are available, the `ChooseEntryMethodModal` is correctly triggered, and the user's choice is processed.

## 4. Access, Economy & Progression

### Access Conditions
- **Status:** ⚠️ **Partially Functional**
- **Findings:** The data models (`BettingChallenge`, `Profile`) have been updated with the necessary fields (`requires_subscription`, `minimum_level`, `required_badges`, `is_subscriber`, `badges`). The `ChallengesAdmin` form allows for configuring these conditions. However, the core `joinChallenge` function in `useMockStore.ts` **does not yet enforce these rules**. It only checks for tickets and coins.
- **Recommendation:** Implement the validation logic for subscription, level, and badges at the beginning of the `joinChallenge` function.

### Player Limits
- **Status:** ⚠️ **Partially Functional**
- **Findings:** The `minimum_players` and `maximum_players` fields are correctly configured in the admin UI and saved to the challenge object. The `joinChallenge` function, however, **does not currently check these limits**. There is no logic to prevent a user from joining a full tournament or to handle the cancellation of an under-subscribed one.
- **Recommendation:** Add checks for `maximum_players` in the `joinChallenge` function. Implement a separate (mock) function to simulate the game start, which would handle the `minimum_players` check and potential cancellation/refunds.

### Initial Balance & Daily Streaks
- **Status:** ✅ **Fully Functional**
- **Findings:** The `processDailyStreak` action correctly calculates streak progression, handles resets after 48 hours of inactivity, and grants the appropriate coin or ticket rewards based on `DAILY_STREAK_REWARDS`. The `ProfilePage` successfully displays the user's streak progress using the `DailyStreakTracker` component.

### Betting Limits per Level
- **Status:** ✅ **Fully Functional**
- **Findings:** The `LEVEL_BET_LIMITS` config is correctly defined. The `ChallengeBetController` component effectively uses this configuration to cap the bet amount slider and input, preventing users from placing bets that exceed their level's limit. The user's max bet is also displayed correctly on their profile.

## 5. Conclusion

The foundational elements of the game's economy and structure are well-implemented. The ticket system, daily streaks, and betting limits are all functioning as designed.

The primary area for immediate improvement is the **enforcement of access conditions and player limits**. The data models and UI are ready, but the core validation logic in the `joinChallenge` function is missing. Implementing this will complete the intended design and create a truly tiered and exclusive tournament experience.

**Overall Status:** ⚠️ **Partially Functional** (pending validation logic implementation).
