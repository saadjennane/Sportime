# Audit Report: Games (v1.1)

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** July 31, 2025  
**Scope:** Core Game Systems (Tournaments, Tickets, Access, Economy)

---

## 1. Functional Summary

The SportTime game ecosystem is built around a multi-tiered tournament structure where players can participate in challenges using either virtual coins or entry tickets. Player engagement is encouraged through a daily login streak system that rewards consistency. Access to higher-tier tournaments is gated by a combination of a player's level, subscription status, and earned badges, creating a clear progression path.

The system is currently implemented with client-side mock data, with all core logic centralized in a Zustand store.

## 2. Daily Streaks & Initial Balance

- **Status:** ✅ **Fully Functional**

### Findings:
- **Initial Balance:** Confirmed. New users (including guests) start with an initial balance of **1,000 coins**. This is handled in the `App.tsx` component during profile creation.
- **Streak Logic:** Confirmed. The `processDailyStreak` action in `src/store/useMockStore.ts` correctly implements the streak logic:
  - It increments the `current_day` if the last login was between 24 and 48 hours ago.
  - It resets the streak to Day 1 if the `last_claimed_at` timestamp is older than 48 hours.
  - It correctly ignores claims within the same 24-hour window.
- **Reward System:** Confirmed. The `DAILY_STREAK_REWARDS` configuration from `src/config/constants.ts` is correctly applied. Coin rewards are added to the user's balance, and a 'rookie' ticket is granted on Day 7.
- **UI Feedback:** Confirmed. The system triggers a toast notification upon successful streak claim. The `ProfilePage` includes a `DailyStreakTracker` component to visualize progress.

## 3. Ticket System

- **Status:** ⚠️ **Partially Functional**

### Findings:
- **Ticket Tiers:** ✅ Confirmed. The system correctly defines and uses three ticket types: `rookie`, `pro`, and `elite`, as seen in `src/types/index.ts`.
- **Dual Entry Logic:** ✅ Confirmed. The `joinChallenge` flow correctly handles all four user states:
  1.  **Coins & Ticket:** The `ChooseEntryMethodModal` is correctly triggered.
  2.  **Ticket Only:** The system defaults to using the ticket.
  3.  **Coins Only:** The system defaults to using coins.
  4.  **Neither:** Access is denied with a toast message.
- **Ticket Consumption:** ✅ Confirmed. The `joinChallenge` action in `useMockStore.ts` correctly identifies a valid ticket (not used, not expired) and marks it as `is_used: true`.
- **UI Integration:** ✅ Confirmed. The `Header.tsx` displays the total ticket count, and the `TicketWalletModal.tsx` provides a correct breakdown of available tickets by tier.
- **Ticket Limits & Expiration:** ⚠️ **Inconsistent.**
  - **Expiration:** The `joinChallenge` logic correctly checks if a ticket is expired before use.
  - **Holding Limit:** The `TICKET_LIMITS` configuration exists, but there is **no logic to enforce it** when a new ticket is granted. A user can accumulate more tickets of a certain type than the defined maximum.

### Recommendations:
1.  Update the `processDailyStreak` function (and any other future ticket-granting functions) to check the user's current ticket count against `TICKET_LIMITS` before adding a new one.

## 4. Tournament Structure & Pricing

- **Status:** ⚠️ **Partially Functional**

### Findings:
- **Tier & Duration System:** ✅ Confirmed. The `BettingChallenge` type and the admin creation form in `ChallengesAdmin.tsx` correctly support the three tiers and three duration types.
- **Dynamic Pricing:** ✅ Confirmed. The entry cost is dynamically calculated in `ChallengesAdmin.tsx` based on the `TOURNAMENT_COSTS` matrix from `src/config/constants.ts`.
- **Player Limits:** ⚠️ **Partially Implemented.**
  - **Maximum Players:** The `joinChallenge` action correctly checks if `challenge.participants.length` has reached `maximum_players` and denies entry if the tournament is full.
  - **Minimum Players:** There is **no logic implemented** to handle the `minimum_players` condition. The system does not currently cancel a tournament or refund players if the minimum threshold is not met by the start time.
- **Admin Override:** ❌ **Missing.** The admin UI does not provide a field for `custom_entry_cost`, so the calculated price cannot be manually overridden.

### Recommendations:
1.  Implement a new function (e.g., `processChallengeStart`) that is simulated to run when a challenge begins. This function should check if `participants.length < minimum_players` and, if so, cancel the challenge and refund all entry fees (both coins and tickets).
2.  Add an optional `custom_entry_cost` input field to the `ChallengesAdmin.tsx` form.

## 5. Conditional Access

- **Status:** ✅ **Fully Functional**

### Findings:
- **Rule Enforcement:** ✅ Confirmed. The `joinChallenge` action in `src/store/useMockStore.ts` correctly validates all three access conditions (`requires_subscription`, `minimum_level`, `required_badges`) before proceeding with the entry process.
- **Data Models:** ✅ Confirmed. The `Profile` and `BettingChallenge` types in `src/types/index.ts` contain all the necessary fields to support this logic. The mock user data includes these fields for testing.
- **Admin UI:** ✅ Confirmed. The `ChallengesAdmin.tsx` component provides the necessary UI controls (checkbox, dropdowns) for an admin to configure these access conditions when creating a new tournament.
- **User Feedback:** ✅ Confirmed. The system correctly throws an error with a descriptive message, which is then displayed as a toast notification to the user, explaining why they cannot join.

## 6. Conclusion

**Overall Status:** ⚠️ **Partially Functional**

The core game loop, including tournament creation, the dual-entry system, and access validation, is well-implemented and functional. The daily streak system also operates as designed.

However, the implementation is incomplete due to two key omissions:
1.  **Lack of `minimum_players` enforcement:** This is a critical missing piece that could lead to a poor user experience if tournaments start with too few players.
2.  **No enforcement of ticket holding limits:** This could disrupt the game's economy by allowing users to hoard tickets beyond the intended design.

These issues prevent the system from being considered fully stable or MVP-complete. Addressing the recommendations above is necessary to finalize the feature set.
