# Audit Report: Rewards Configurator v1.6

**Date:** July 31, 2025  
**Scope:** Smart Range Validation & Stability Check  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Verified

---

## üèÅ Conclusion

The Rewards Configurator v1.6 is **üü¢ Fully Functional**. The implementation successfully addresses all key requirements from the prompt, including robust validation against overlapping ranges, persistent reward lines, and the implementation of admin "power-up" features. The system is now stable, intuitive, and aligned with the intended design.

## ‚úÖ Confirmed Functional Elements

### 1. Smart Range & Overlap Validation
- **Status:** Fully Functional
- **Verification:** The `AddRewardLineModal.tsx` component now contains a `validationError` memo that correctly checks for overlaps before a new reward line can be saved.
- **Tests Passed:**
    - Attempting to create a duplicate rank (e.g., "1st") is blocked.
    - Creating a partially overlapping numeric range (e.g., "4-10" when "6-12" exists) is blocked.
    - The "Save" button is correctly disabled, and an inline error message is displayed when an overlap is detected.
- **File Reference:** `src/components/admin/AddRewardLineModal.tsx`

### 2. Persistent Reward Lines
- **Status:** Fully Functional
- **Verification:** The `RewardsConfigurator.tsx` component now manages an internal `rewardLines` state. It correctly renders all lines from the base pack template, regardless of whether they contain rewards.
- **Tests Passed:**
    - The "Clear Line" (`üßπ`) button successfully removes all rewards from a line (`line.rewards = []`) without deleting the line itself from the UI.
    - The UI remains stable and persistent, providing a consistent editing experience.
- **File Reference:** `src/components/admin/RewardsConfigurator.tsx`

### 3. Admin Power-Up Features
- **Status:** Fully Functional
- **Verification:**
    - **"Reset to Base" (`üîÑ`):** This function correctly reloads the default reward pack from `BASE_REWARD_PACKS` based on the game's `tier` and `format`.
    - **"Save as Base Pack" (`üíæ`):** This function correctly calls the `updateBasePack` action in the store, updating the in-memory state of the base packs for the current session. This is the correct mock implementation pending a backend.
    - **Drag-and-Drop Reordering:** Integration with `@dnd-kit` is successful. Admins can visually reorder reward lines, and the changes are correctly reflected in the component's state.
- **File References:** `src/components/admin/RewardsConfigurator.tsx`, `src/store/useMockStore.ts`

### 4. Tier & Format Auto-Detection
- **Status:** Fully Functional
- **Verification:** The `RewardsConfigurator` correctly receives the `tier` and `format` from the parent `GameCreationForm.tsx`. When these values change in the form, the configurator correctly identifies the change and can load the appropriate base pack.
- **File Reference:** `src/components/admin/GameCreationForm.tsx`

### 5. Stability & Player-Facing Compatibility
- **Status:** Fully Functional
- **Verification:** The `RewardsPreviewModal.tsx` component correctly interprets the new structured `GameRewardTier` data model, displaying ranks, ranges, and percentages to the player as intended. No regressions were found.
- **File Reference:** `src/components/RewardsPreviewModal.tsx`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented

- **Automatic Sorting on Insertion:** When a new range is added, it is appended to the end of the list rather than being automatically sorted into its logical position. While drag-and-drop allows for manual correction, this optional enhancement was not implemented.

---

## ‚ùå Missing or Incorrect Implementations

- No missing or incorrect implementations were found based on the v1.6 prompt requirements. The system is stable and complete.

## üí° Recommendations

1.  **Implement Automatic Sorting:** To further improve the user experience, consider adding a sort function that runs after a new line is added in `RewardsConfigurator.tsx`. This would automatically place the new range in its correct logical order, reducing manual effort for the admin.
    - **File:** `src/components/admin/RewardsConfigurator.tsx`
    - **Suggestion:** After `onRewardsChange([...rewardLines, newLine])`, add a follow-up call to sort the `rewardLines` array based on the `start` value of each line.
