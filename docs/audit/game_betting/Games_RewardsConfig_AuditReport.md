# Audit Report: Rewards Configurator v1.5

**Date:** July 31, 2025  
**Auditor:** Dualite Alpha  
**Status:** üü° Partially Functional

---

## üìù Summary of Findings

The audit of the Rewards Configurator v1.5 reveals a significant gap between the intended design and the current implementation. While the foundational data structures (`BASE_REWARD_PACKS`) and some UI components (`AddRewardModal`, `RewardsPreviewModal`) exist, they are not correctly integrated or utilized.

The core features of **persistent reward lines**, **smart range creation**, and **admin power-ups** are currently **non-functional**. The admin UI does not auto-populate rewards, does not enforce line persistence, and lacks the logic for validation and saving new base packs.

---

## ‚úÖ Confirmed Functional Elements

- **Data Structure Definition**: The `GameRewardTier` and `RewardItem` types are correctly defined in `src/types/index.ts`.
- **Base Pack Configuration**: The `BASE_REWARD_PACKS` constant is defined in `src/config/rewardPacks.ts` with a structure that matches the design (tiers, formats, and reward arrays).
- **Modal Components**: The `AddRewardModal` and `RewardsPreviewModal` components exist, though their integration is incomplete.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented

- **Tier & Format Auto-Detection**: The `GameCreationForm` has dropdowns for `tier` and `duration_type` (format), but the `RewardsConfigurator` does not appear to be using these values to dynamically load the corresponding base pack. The data flow is broken.
- **State Management**: While the `useMockStore` has an `updateGameRewards` action, it's unclear if it's being used correctly by the configurator. The "Save as Base Pack" action (`updateBasePack`) is missing entirely.

---

## ‚ùå Missing or Incorrect Implementations

- **Persistent Reward Lines**: **This is the main point of failure.** The `RewardsConfigurator` does not render persistent lines based on a template. Instead, it appears to render lines dynamically based on the `rewards` array passed to it. If this array is empty, nothing is shown. The concept of a fixed, editable structure is not implemented.
- **Smart Range Creation**: The "Add Range / Percent" button and its associated modal (`AddRewardLineModal`) are not visible or integrated into the `RewardsConfigurator`. The logic for validating overlaps is also missing.
- **"Save as Base Pack" & "Reset to Base"**: These admin power-up features are not implemented. There is no button in the UI and no corresponding `updateBasePack` action in the store. The "Reset" functionality is also absent.
- **Drag-and-Drop Reordering**: This feature is not implemented. The required dependencies (`@dnd-kit`) may not be installed, and the UI does not include drag handles or the necessary logic.
- **UI Layout**: The current UI does not match the target layout. It lacks the header with base pack info, the persistent line structure, and the "Add Range / Percent" button.

## üí° Recommendations

1.  **Refactor `RewardsConfigurator.tsx` (High Priority)**:
    - The component must manage an internal state (e.g., `rewardLines: GameRewardTier[]`).
    - Use a `useEffect` hook to initialize `rewardLines` from the correct base pack (`BASE_REWARD_PACKS[tier][format]`) when the `tier` or `format` props change.
    - The main render loop must iterate over this `rewardLines` state, ensuring all lines are always visible.
    - Implement the "Clear Line" action to only empty the `rewards` array of a specific line, not remove the line itself.

2.  **Implement Smart Range Creation (High Priority)**:
    - Add the "Add Range / Percent" button.
    - Create and integrate the `AddRewardLineModal.tsx` component.
    - Implement the validation logic to prevent overlapping ranks, ranges, and percentages before allowing a new line to be added.

3.  **Add Admin Power-ups (Medium Priority)**:
    - Add the "Save as Base Pack" button to the UI.
    - Implement the `updateBasePack` action in `useMockStore.ts`. To make this work, `BASE_REWARD_PACKS` should be moved into the Zustand state to be mutable.
    - Add the "Reset to Base" button that re-runs the initialization logic from the (potentially updated) base pack in the store.

4.  **Integrate Drag-and-Drop (Medium Priority)**:
    - Install `@dnd-kit/core` and `@dnd-kit/sortable`.
    - Wrap the list of reward lines in the necessary DndKit context providers and implement the `onDragEnd` handler to reorder the `rewardLines` state.

5.  **Update Player-Facing Preview**:
    - Refactor `RewardsPreviewModal.tsx` to correctly interpret and display the new `GameRewardTier` structure (e.g., converting `{ positionType: 'range', start: 4, end: 10 }` to the string "Ranks 4-10").

## üèÅ Conclusion

**Status:** üî¥ **Incomplete**

The Rewards Configuration system is currently in a foundational state. The backend data structures are defined, but the frontend admin interface is missing all of the core logic required for it to be functional. The system does not auto-populate rewards, does not maintain persistent lines, and lacks the key features of smart range creation and base pack management. A significant refactor of `RewardsConfigurator.tsx` is required to align it with the v1.5 specifications.
