# Audit Report: Rewards Configurator v1.7

**Date:** July 31, 2025
**Scope:** Verification of automatic sorting logic and stability check of the Rewards Configurator.

---

## ✅ Confirmed Functional Elements

The audit confirms that all features targeted in the v1.7 update have been successfully implemented and are fully functional.

1.  **Automatic Sorting on Insertion:**
    - **Status:** 🟢 **Fully Functional**
    - **Finding:** The `sortRewardLines` function in `src/components/admin/RewardsConfigurator.tsx` correctly sorts new lines upon insertion. The sorting logic correctly prioritizes by `positionType` ('rank' -> 'range' -> 'percent') and then by the `start` value. Adding lines in any order results in a correctly sorted list in the UI.

2.  **Sorting Logic Stability:**
    - **Status:** 🟢 **Fully Functional**
    - **Finding:** The sorting logic is stable and handles mixed line types correctly. It does not trigger re-render loops. Edge cases are handled by the validation in the `AddRewardLineModal`, preventing malformed data from entering the sort function.

3.  **Drag-and-Drop Compatibility:**
    - **Status:** 🟢 **Fully Functional**
    - **Finding:** Manual reordering via drag-and-drop (`handleDragEnd` function) correctly overrides the automatic sort order. The automatic sorting is only triggered on line insertion, not on manual reordering, allowing admins to have full control over the final order if desired.

4.  **Regression: Validation & Persistence:**
    - **Status:** 🟢 **Fully Functional**
    - **Finding:** The overlap validation logic from v1.6 in `src/components/admin/AddRewardLineModal.tsx` remains fully intact and correctly prevents the creation of duplicate or overlapping ranges. The persistent line behavior (clearing without deleting) and the "Reset to Base" functionality also work as expected.

5.  **Admin Power-Up Features:**
    - **Status:** 🟢 **Fully Functional**
    - **Finding:** The "Save as Base Pack" feature correctly saves the current (and sorted) line configuration as the new default in the `useMockStore`. The "Reset to Base" feature correctly reloads and re-sorts the default pack.

6.  **Player-Facing Preview Compatibility:**
    - **Status:** 🟢 **Fully Functional**
    - **Finding:** The `RewardsPreviewModal.tsx` correctly displays the reward tiers in the new logical order, as the data it receives from the `game` object is already sorted by the configurator. The UI is stable and accurately reflects the admin's configuration.

## ⚠️ Partially Implemented

- **None.** All specified features were implemented as designed.

---

## ❌ Missing or Incorrect Implementations

- **None.** The implementation aligns with the v1.7 prompt requirements.

---

## 💡 Recommendations

- **Centralize Sorting Logic:** For even better maintainability, the `sortRewardLines` function could be moved to a shared utility file (e.g., `src/lib/sorters.ts` or `src/utils/rewardsUtils.ts`) if it needs to be used elsewhere in the future. For now, its current location is acceptable.
- **UI Feedback on Sort:** Consider adding a very brief visual flash or highlight to the newly inserted line to make its automatic placement in the sorted list more obvious to the admin.

## 🏁 Conclusion

**Overall Status:** 🟢 **Fully Functional**

The Rewards Configurator v1.7 update is a success. The automatic sorting on insertion has been implemented correctly and works seamlessly with the existing validation, persistence, and drag-and-drop features. The system is stable, intuitive, and ready for production use.
