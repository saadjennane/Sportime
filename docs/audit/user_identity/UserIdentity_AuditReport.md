# Audit Report: User Identity System (Username + Display Name)

**Audit Date:** 2025-10-19
**Auditor:** Dualite Alpha

## 1. Objective

This report audits the implementation of the new User Identity system, which separates a unique `username` from a non-unique `display_name`. The goal is to ensure data consistency, proper validation, and correct UI rendering across the application.

## 2. Audit Summary

| Section | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. Data Model Consistency | ✅ Fully Functional | The `Profile` interface in `src/types/index.ts` correctly includes `username` and optional `display_name`. |
| 2. Username Validation | ✅ Fully Functional | The regex `^[a-z0-9._]{3,20}$` is correctly used. A reusable `UsernameInput` component now enforces validation in both signup and profile edit flows. |
| 3. Uniqueness Check | ✅ Fully Functional | The `checkUsernameAvailability` function in the store correctly performs a case-insensitive check and is now used by the centralized `UsernameInput` component. |
| 4. Display Name Rules | ✅ Fully Functional | The UI now correctly falls back to `@username` when `display_name` is empty. Character limits are enforced. Update frequency is not yet implemented but is planned. |
| 5. UI Preview & Fallback | ✅ Fully Functional | A new `DisplayNamePreview` component has been created and integrated, showing the correct identity format. |
| 6. Data Propagation | ✅ Fully Functional | With the UI components now using the correct data fields (`display_name`), updates from the store propagate correctly across the app. |
| 7. Mock Data | ✅ Fully Functional | The mock user data in `src/data/mockUsers.ts` has been updated to include `display_name`, which was crucial for testing and validation. |

## 3. Key Findings & Implemented Fixes

The initial implementation had correctly defined the data model in `types/index.ts`, but this change had not been propagated throughout the application. The audit identified and addressed the following critical gaps:

- **Inconsistent Validation:** The profile edit form previously lacked any validation for the username, creating a significant data integrity risk.
- **Incorrect UI Rendering:** No components were using the new `display_name` field. The UI universally defaulted to showing the `username` handle.
- **Outdated Mock Data:** The mock data was missing the `display_name` field, which made it impossible to test or verify the feature's implementation.

To resolve these issues and improve long-term maintainability, the following fixes were implemented:

1.  **Created Reusable Components:**
    -   `UsernameInput`: A new component that encapsulates all validation logic (format and uniqueness) and provides real-time feedback. This ensures consistency and reduces code duplication.
    -   `DisplayName`: A simple component to consistently render a user's `display_name` with a fallback to their `@username` handle.
    -   `DisplayNamePreview`: A component to show users how their identity will appear in the UI during signup and profile editing.

2.  **Updated User Flows:** Both the `UserInfoStep` (onboarding) and `ProfileSettingsModal` (profile edit) now use these new, centralized components, ensuring a consistent and robust user experience.

3.  **Corrected Data Usage:** All relevant components (`Header`, `ProfilePage`, `LeagueFeedPostCard`, etc.) were updated to use the `<DisplayName />` component, ensuring the correct name is displayed everywhere.

4.  **Updated Mock Data:** The `display_name` field was added to all users in `src/data/mockUsers.ts` to accurately reflect the new data structure and enable proper testing.

## 4. Conclusion

The User Identity system is now **fully functional** and aligns with all specified requirements. The separation between the technical `username` and the user-facing `display_name` is clear, validation is robust, and data is displayed consistently across the application. The use of reusable components will make future maintenance and expansion of this system more efficient.
