# Audit Report: User Identity System (Username + Display Name)

- **Date:** October 19, 2025
- **Auditor:** Dualite Alpha
- **Status:** ✅ Completed & Remediated

---

## 1. Objective

This audit was conducted to perform a full review of the recently implemented Username + Display Name system. The goal was to ensure data consistency, proper validation and uniqueness checks, correct UI fallback behavior, and successful data propagation across the application after profile updates.

---

## 2. Summary of Findings

The initial implementation correctly defined the data model in `src/types/index.ts`, but this change was not propagated consistently throughout the application. Key issues included incomplete validation in the profile edit form, a universal failure to display the `display_name` in the UI, and outdated mock data that did not reflect the new structure.

All identified issues have been **remediated**. The system is now fully functional and consistent with the specified requirements.

## 3. Detailed Audit Results

| Section | Initial Status | Remediation Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Data Model Consistency** | ✅ Fully Functional | N/A | The `Profile` interface in `src/types/index.ts` was correct from the start. |
| **2. Username Validation** | ⚠️ Partially Functional | ✅ **Fixed** | The regex for format validation was missing, and the profile edit form had no validation. A reusable `UsernameInput` component was created and implemented to resolve this. |
| **3. Uniqueness Check** | ⚠️ Partially Functional | ✅ **Fixed** | The uniqueness check was missing from the profile edit form. This logic was centralized in `useMockStore` and is now used by the new `UsernameInput` component in both signup and edit flows. |
| **4. Display Name Rules** | ❌ Missing | ✅ **Fixed** | The application was not using `display_name` anywhere. A new `DisplayName` component was created to handle rendering and fallback logic, and it has been integrated across the UI. |
| **5. UI Preview & Fallback** | ❌ Missing | ✅ **Fixed** | A new `DisplayNamePreview` component was created and integrated into the signup and profile edit forms to provide a live preview of the user's identity. |
| **6. Data Propagation** | ✅ Fully Functional | N/A | The underlying state management with Zustand was sound. Once UI components were fixed, data propagated as expected. |
| **7. Mock Data** | ❌ Missing | ✅ **Fixed** | The mock user data in `src/data/mockUsers.ts` was updated to include the `display_name` field, which was a root cause for many UI issues. |

## 4. Conclusion

The User Identity System now correctly distinguishes between a unique `username` and a flexible `display_name`. Validation, uniqueness checks, and UI rendering have been standardized through the creation of reusable components (`UsernameInput`, `DisplayName`, `DisplayNamePreview`). The system is robust, consistent, and meets all specified acceptance criteria.
