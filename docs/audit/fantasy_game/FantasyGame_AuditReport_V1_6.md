# Audit Report: Fantasy Game v1.6 – Manual Substitutions

**Version:** 1.6
**Date:** July 31, 2025
**Auditor:** Dualite Alpha
**Status:** ✅ Fully Functional

---

## 1. Functional Summary

This audit verifies the implementation of the **Manual Substitution** feature added in version 1.6. The feature allows users to manually replace a starting player who is confirmed as DNP (Did Not Play) with a substitute from the bench during a live GameWeek.

The user flow is as follows:
1.  During a `live` GameWeek, if a player in the starting lineup is marked as DNP, the user can interact with them on the fantasy pitch.
2.  Clicking the DNP player opens a `SubstitutionModal`.
3.  The modal displays available substitutes from the bench who play the **same position** as the DNP player.
4.  The user selects a substitute to bring in.
5.  The system swaps the two players between the `starters` and `substitutes` lists.
6.  If the DNP player was the captain, captaincy is automatically transferred to the incoming substitute.
7.  The team state is updated, and subsequent live scoring calculations use the new lineup.

## 2. Architecture & File References

The implementation is well-integrated into the existing component structure and state management flow.

-   **`src/pages/FantasyGameWeekPage.tsx`**: This is the main orchestrator.
    -   It identifies DNP starters using a `useMemo` hook.
    -   The `handlePitchSlotClick` function now contains logic to detect a click on a DNP player during a live game, which triggers the substitution modal by setting the `substitutingPlayer` state.
    -   The `handleSubstitution` function contains the core logic for swapping players, transferring captaincy, and calling the store action to update the state.

-   **`src/components/fantasy/SubstitutionModal.tsx`**: A new modal component that receives the DNP player and a filtered list of available substitutes, handling the user's selection.

-   **`src/components/fantasy/PlayerCircle.tsx`**: The UI for each player on the pitch. While it doesn't have a dedicated "substitute" button, the `onClick` handler is now context-aware. It correctly displays a "DNP" overlay for players who did not play.

-   **`src/store/useMockStore.ts`**: The `updateUserFantasyTeam` action is used to persist the new lineup (starters and substitutes) to the global state, ensuring the change is reflected across the app and used in subsequent scoring ticks.

-   **`src/services/fantasyService.ts`**: The `processGameWeek` function remains unchanged, as it correctly reads the updated `starters` list from the state for scoring. This demonstrates a clean separation of concerns.

## 3. Substitution Logic Verification

-   **Triggering:** The substitution flow is correctly triggered only for `live` GameWeeks and only for starters confirmed as DNP. This is handled in `FantasyGameWeekPage.tsx`.
-   **Validation:** The substitution modal correctly filters `availableSubs` to only show players of the same position as the DNP starter.
-   **State Update:** The `handleSubstitution` function correctly creates new `starters` and `substitutes` arrays and updates the Zustand store.
-   **Captaincy Transfer:** The logic correctly checks if `captain_id === dnpPlayerId` and reassigns it to `subPlayerId`, ensuring no points are lost from a DNP captain.

## 4. Edge Cases & Discrepancies

-   **No Available Substitutes:** If no substitute of the same position is available on the bench, the modal correctly displays a "No available substitutes" message.
-   **UI Feedback:** The `PlayerCircle` component does not have a separate, explicit "Substitute" button. The action is triggered by clicking the entire player circle. This is a minor UI choice and does not affect functionality. The "DNP" overlay provides sufficient context for the user to know an action is possible.
-   **Regression:** No regressions were found in other features (boosters, scoring, pre-game editing). The substitution logic is well-contained within the `live` game phase.

## 5. Conclusion

The Manual Substitution feature (v1.6) is **Fully Functional** and correctly implemented according to the specifications. The logic is sound, handles edge cases gracefully, and integrates cleanly with the existing state management and scoring engine. The system is robust and ready for further development.
