# Audit Report: Fantasy Game v1.7 â€“ Recovery Boost &amp; Fatigue Visualization

**Version:** 1.7  
**Audit Date:** July 31, 2025  
**Auditor:** Dualite Alpha  
**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ **Partially Functional**

---

## 1. Functional Summary

This audit verifies the implementation of the v1.7 enhancements for the Fantasy Game, which include the finalization of the **Recovery Boost** feature and the introduction of a **visual fatigue system**.

The user flow is as follows:
1.  **Team Management:** Users can manage their lineup for an upcoming GameWeek. A new color-coded fatigue bar is now visible on each player, providing an at-a-glance view of their fitness.
2.  **Booster Selection:** When selecting the "Recovery Boost," a modal now prompts the user to choose a specific field player (non-Goalkeeper) as the target.
3.  **GameWeek Processing:** After the GameWeek, the system processes scores. If the player targeted by the Recovery Boost played, their fatigue is restored to 100% before scoring. If they did not play (DNP), the booster is intended to be refunded.
4.  **Results:** The final scores and updated fatigue levels are reflected in the UI.

## 2. Architecture Overview &amp; File References

The v1.7 feature set is primarily implemented across the following files:

-   **`src/components/BoosterSelectionModal.tsx`**: Contains the updated UI logic for selecting a target player for the Recovery Boost.
-   **`src/services/fantasyService.ts`**: The `processGameWeek` function within this service contains the core backend logic for applying or refunding the Recovery Boost.
-   **`src/components/fantasy/FatigueBar.tsx`**: This new component handles the visual representation of player fatigue, including color-coding and tooltips.
-   **`src/components/fantasy/PlayerCircle.tsx`**: Integrates the `FatigueBar` to display player fatigue directly on the pitch view.
-   **`src/store/useMockStore.ts`**: The `updateUserFantasyTeam` action is used to persist state changes, including booster refunds.

## 3. Verification of v1.7 Features

### a. Recovery Boost Logic

-   **Target Selection (UI):** âœ… **Fully Functional**
    -   The `BoosterSelectionModal.tsx` correctly displays a list of the 7 field players when the Recovery Boost is selected.
    -   The UI allows a user to select a target, highlights the selection, and correctly stores the `booster_target_id`.
    -   The "Confirm" button is appropriately disabled until a target is chosen.

-   **Backend & Refund Logic:** ðŸŸ¡ **Partially Functional / Non-Functional**
    -   The logic in `processGameWeek()` correctly identifies the targeted player and checks if they played (`minutes_played > 0`).
    -   If the player played, their fatigue is correctly reset to `1.0`.
    -   **Discrepancy:** If the player did not play (DNP), the current implementation **fails to refund the booster**. It logs a console message but does not reset `team.booster_used` to `null`. This means the booster is consumed even if the player did not play, which contradicts the feature's requirements.

### b. Fatigue Visualization System

-   **Visual Indicator:** âœ… **Fully Functional**
    -   The `FatigueBar.tsx` component correctly implements the color-coded thresholds:
        -   `â‰¥ 90%`: Green (`from-lime-glow`)
        -   `70-89%`: Yellow (`from-yellow-400`)
        -   `50-69%`: Orange (`from-orange-400`)
        -   `< 50%`: Red (`from-hot-red`)
    -   The fatigue bar is successfully integrated into `PlayerCircle.tsx`, making fatigue levels visible on the main pitch view.
-   **Tooltip:** âœ… **Fully Functional**
    -   On hover, the `title` attribute of the fatigue bar correctly displays the exact fatigue percentage (e.g., "Fatigue: 82%").

## 4. Regression Check

A check of pre-existing v1.4/v1.6 features confirms their stability:

-   **PGS Formula:** âœ… **Functional**. The `computePGS` function in `src/lib/fantasy/engine.ts` correctly includes the playtime ratio adjustment.
-   **Team Validation:** âœ… **Functional**. The "Confirm Team" button in `FantasyGameWeekPage.tsx` remains disabled if GameWeek conditions (e.g., max 2 players per club) are violated.
-   **Other Boosters & Scoring:** âœ… **Functional**. The scoring chain and multipliers for other boosters remain intact and function as expected.
-   **Manual Substitutions:** âœ… **Functional**. The UI and logic for manually substituting a DNP player during a live GameWeek are still present and operational.

## 5. Conclusion & Recommendations

**Overall Status: ðŸŸ¡ Partially Functional**

The v1.7 update successfully introduces the UI for targeting a player with the Recovery Boost and the new fatigue visualization system. Both of these frontend features are fully functional and well-implemented.

However, the implementation is critically flawed by the **failure of the backend logic to refund the Recovery Boost** when the targeted player does not play. Because the booster is consumed regardless of player participation, the feature does not meet its core requirement and will lead to a negative user experience.

**Recommendation:**
The immediate priority is to fix the refund logic in `src/services/fantasyService.ts`. The `processGameWeek` function must be updated to set `booster_used` and `booster_target_id` to `null` when a targeted player is DNP, and this state change must be persisted via the `updateUserFantasyTeam` store action.
