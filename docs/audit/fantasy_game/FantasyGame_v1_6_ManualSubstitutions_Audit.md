**Date:** July 31, 2025  
**Author:** Dualite Alpha  
**Status:** ✅ Fully Functional (v1.6 MVP Complete)

## 1. Functional Summary

This audit verifies the implementation of the **Manual Substitution** feature, which allows users to replace a starting player confirmed as **DNP (Did Not Play)** with an eligible substitute during a live GameWeek.

The user flow is as follows:
1.  During a live GameWeek (`status: 'live'`), if a starting player's `liveStatus` becomes `dnp`, a "Substitute" button appears on their player circle on the pitch.
2.  Clicking this button opens a **Substitution Modal**, which lists available substitutes from the bench who play the same position.
3.  The user selects an eligible substitute and confirms the action.
4.  The system swaps the players between the `starters` and `substitutes` arrays in the user's team state.
5.  If the DNP player was the captain, captaincy is automatically transferred to the incoming substitute.
6.  The UI updates instantly to reflect the new lineup, and subsequent scoring calculations will use this updated team.

## 2. Architecture Overview

The feature is primarily implemented on the frontend, leveraging the existing state management system.

-   **`FantasyGameWeekPage.tsx`**: This page now contains the primary logic for identifying DNP starters, managing the state of the `SubstitutionModal`, and handling the `handleSubstitution` action.
-   **`SubstitutionModal.tsx`**: A new, dedicated component that receives the DNP player and available substitutes, and calls back with the user's selection.
-   **`PlayerCircle.tsx`**: This UI component has been updated to conditionally render the "Substitute" button when a player is marked as DNP during a live game.
-   **`useMockStore.ts`**: The existing `updateUserFantasyTeam` action is used to persist the changes to the team's lineup (`starters` and `substitutes` arrays), ensuring the change is reflected globally.
-   **`fantasyService.ts`**: No changes were required in the backend service. The manual substitution is a state update that occurs *before* the next scoring tick, so the `processGameWeek` function naturally uses the updated lineup for its calculations.

## 3. Substitution Logic

The substitution logic is sound and correctly implemented according to the specifications.

-   **Trigger Condition**: The "Substitute" button is correctly rendered only if `player.liveStatus === 'dnp'` and `isLive === true`.
-   **Position Matching**: The `SubstitutionModal` correctly filters the `substitutes` array to show only players whose `position` matches that of the `dnpPlayer`.
-   **State Update**: The `handleSubstitution` function correctly swaps the player IDs in the `starters` and `substitutes` arrays and updates the state via `updateUserFantasyTeam`.
-   **Captaincy Transfer**: The logic correctly checks if the `dnpPlayer.id` matches the `captain_id`. If it does, the `captain_id` is updated to the `subPlayerId`, ensuring the captaincy bonus is not lost.

## 4. UI/Frontend Behavior

-   **Visual Cue**: A "Substitute" button now correctly appears on the `PlayerCircle` of a DNP starter, providing a clear and intuitive entry point for the user.
-   **Modal Flow**: The `SubstitutionModal` is presented with a clear list of eligible substitutes, and the confirmation action is straightforward.
-   **Reactive UI**: Upon confirming a substitution, the `FantasyPitch` and `Bench` components update instantly to show the new player arrangement.

## 5. File References

-   **Primary Logic**: `src/pages/FantasyGameWeekPage.tsx` (handles state and substitution logic)
-   **UI Trigger**: `src/components/fantasy/PlayerCircle.tsx` (displays the "Substitute" button)
-   **Modal UI**: `src/components/fantasy/SubstitutionModal.tsx` (new component for player selection)
-   **State Persistence**: `src/store/useMockStore.ts` (via the `updateUserFantasyTeam` action)

---

## 6. Edge Cases & Discrepancies

The implementation handles key edge cases gracefully:

-   **No Available Substitutes**: If no substitutes on the bench match the DNP player's position, the modal correctly shows an empty state, and the user cannot proceed.
-   **Substitution Already Made**: The logic does not currently prevent a player from being subbed back out, but since the trigger is `liveStatus === 'dnp'`, this is a non-issue. Once a player is subbed out, they are no longer a starter and cannot be subbed again.
-   **No Discrepancies**: The implementation fully matches the requirements of the v1.6 prompt.

## 7. Conclusion

The **Manual Substitution** feature is **Fully Functional** and correctly integrated into the Fantasy Game module. It provides a valuable layer of interactivity for users during live GameWeeks and completes the v1.6 feature set. The system is now ready for further documentation and can be considered **MVP-complete**.
