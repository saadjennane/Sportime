# Audit Report: Fantasy Game v1.5 – Recovery Boost Target Logic Verification

**Date:** July 31, 2025  
**Auditor:** Dualite Alpha  
**Status:** ✅ Fully Functional (v1.5 Compliant)

---

## 1. Functional Summary

This audit verifies the v1.5 enhancements to the Fantasy Game, focusing on the finalization of the **Recovery Boost** feature. The update introduces a player targeting UI and implements a crucial refund mechanism if the targeted player does not play (DNP).

The system now correctly:
- Allows the user to select a specific field player as the target for the Recovery Boost.
- Applies the fatigue recovery effect only if the targeted player participates in the match.
- Refunds the booster (i.e., does not consume it) if the targeted player is DNP, making it available for a future GameWeek.
- Maintains the integrity of all pre-existing v1.4 features, including PGS calculations, other boosters, and team validation.

## 2. Architecture & File References

The implementation successfully integrates the new logic into the existing architecture.

- **Target Selection UI:** `src/components/BoosterSelectionModal.tsx`
  - The modal now includes a second step for "Recovery Boost" to select a target player from the user's lineup.
  - It correctly passes the `booster` and `targetId` to the parent component.
- **State Management & UI Control:** `src/pages/FantasyGameWeekPage.tsx`
  - The `handleBoosterSelect` function was updated to handle the `targetId`.
  - A `useEffect` hook was added to persist the booster refund by calling a new store action, `updateUserFantasyTeam`.
- **Refund & Application Logic:** `src/services/fantasyService.ts`
  - The `processGameWeek` function was refactored to return both the `simulationResult` and an `updatedTeam` object.
  - It now contains the DNP check and correctly modifies the `booster_used` and `booster_target_id` fields on the `updatedTeam` copy if a refund is necessary.
- **State Persistence:** `src/store/useMockStore.ts`
  - A new action, `updateUserFantasyTeam`, was added to allow the component to save the refunded booster state back to the global store.

## 3. Verification of v1.5 Checklist

### a. Recovery Boost Targeting
- **Status:** ✅ **Fully Functional**
- **Finding:** The `BoosterSelectionModal` now correctly displays a list of the 7 field players when "Recovery Boost" is selected. The user can select a target, and the "Confirm" button is only enabled after a selection is made. The `targetId` is correctly passed to the `FantasyGameWeekPage`.

### b. Refund Logic (DNP)
- **Status:** ✅ **Fully Functional**
- **Finding:** The `processGameWeek` service now accurately detects if a targeted player has `minutes_played > 0`. If not, it creates a modified `updatedTeam` object where `booster_used` and `booster_target_id` are reset to `null`. This object is then used via a `useEffect` hook in the main page to update the global state, effectively refunding the booster.

### c. Booster Consumption Rule
- **Status:** ✅ **Fully Functional**
- **Finding:** The booster is only considered "used" (i.e., not refunded) if the targeted field player participates in the match. This logic is correctly implemented.

### d. UI & Data Flow
- **Status:** ✅ **Fully Functional**
- **Finding:** The data flow is sound. The UI triggers the targeting, the service layer calculates the outcome (including potential refund), and the component layer persists the state change back to the store. The UI updates reactively to show the refunded booster.

### e. Pre-existing System Integrity
- **Status:** ✅ **Verified**
- **Finding:** All v1.4 systems, including PGS calculation, other boosters (Double Impact, Golden Game), scoring chain, and team validation, were tested and found to be unaffected by the v1.5 changes. No regressions were detected.

## 4. Conclusion

The Fantasy Game is now **Fully Functional** and compliant with the v1.5 rule set. The Recovery Boost feature is complete, with a functional UI for targeting and robust backend logic for application and refunds. The architecture is stable and ready for further development.
