# Audit Report: Fantasy Game v1.4 Compliance Check

**Version:** 1.4  
**Date:** July 31, 2025  
**Auditor:** Dualite Alpha  
**Status:** âœ… Fully Functional & Compliant

---

## 1. Audit Summary

This audit verifies the implementation of the v1.4 compliance upgrades for the Sportime Fantasy Game. The focus was on three key areas: the Player Game Score (PGS) formula, the "Recovery Boost" booster logic, and team validation rule enforcement.

The audit confirms that all requested changes have been successfully implemented. The system now uses a more nuanced PGS calculation, a smarter and fairer Recovery Boost, and prevents users from submitting invalid team lineups.

## 2. Verification of Implemented Changes

### ðŸ§  Player Status Formula (PGS)
- **Status:** âœ… **Fully Implemented**
- **File:** `src/lib/fantasy/engine.ts`
- **Function:** `computePGS()`

**Findings:**
- The `computePGS` function has been updated to include the playtime ratio adjustment as specified.
- The base formula `(rating * 0.5) + (impact * 0.3) + (consistency * 0.2)` is correctly used.
- The playtime bonus is applied correctly: `+0.3` for â‰¥90% playtime, `+0.15` for 50-89%, and `+0.05` for <50%.
- The `updateAllPlayerStatuses` function in `src/services/fantasyService.ts` correctly calls this new logic to assign PGS and status labels to all players.

### ðŸ’Š Recovery Boost Logic
- **Status:** âœ… **Fully Implemented**
- **File:** `src/services/fantasyService.ts`
- **Function:** `processGameWeek()`

**Findings:**
- The `processGameWeek` function now checks for the Recovery Boost (`booster_used === 3`).
- It correctly identifies the `booster_target_id` and verifies that the target is a field player (`position !== 'Goalkeeper'`).
- **DNP Handling:** The logic correctly checks if the target player has `minutes_played > 0` using the `gameWeekStats`.
  - If the player DNP, fatigue is **not** modified, and a `boosterStatus` message ("Recovery Boost refunded...") is returned.
  - If the player played, fatigue is set to `1.0` before scoring calculations, and an appropriate `boosterStatus` message is returned.
- The `LivePointsBreakdown.tsx` component has been updated to display this `boosterStatus` message, providing clear feedback to the user.

### ðŸ§± Team Validation Enforcement
- **Status:** âœ… **Fully Implemented**
- **File:** `src/pages/FantasyGameWeekPage.tsx`

**Findings:**
- A `useMemo` hook (`areConditionsMet`) has been added to `FantasyGameWeekPage.tsx` to perform real-time validation of the user's `effectiveStarters` against the `selectedGameWeek.conditions`.
- The "Confirm Team" button is now correctly `disabled` if `areConditionsMet` is `false`.
- A `title` attribute has been added to the button to provide a tooltip explaining why it's disabled (e.g., "Your team violates GameWeek rules...").
- The validation correctly checks for the "Max 2 players per club" rule.

### ðŸ§® Minor Adjustments
- **Status:** âœ… **Verified**
- **Fatigue Clamp:** The `calculateFatigue` function in `src/lib/fantasy/engine.ts` was reviewed and confirmed to have no lower limit clamp, allowing fatigue to drop below any specific threshold.
- **Captain Multiplier:** The `FANTASY_CONFIG` in `src/lib/fantasy/engine.ts` has been updated to set `boosters.double_impact` to `2.0`, ensuring the correct `x2` multiplier is used in the calculation chain.

## 3. UI Flow for Recovery Boost

- **File:** `src/pages/FantasyGameWeekPage.tsx`
- **File:** `src/components/fantasy/PlayerCircle.tsx`

**Findings:**
- A new state, `targetingBooster`, has been added to manage the booster targeting flow.
- When the "Recovery Boost" is selected from the `BoosterSelectionModal`, the page enters a targeting mode, and an informational toast guides the user.
- Clicking on a valid field player (via `handlePitchSlotClick` or `handleBenchSlotClick`) correctly sets the `booster_used` and `booster_target_id` on the `userTeam` state.
- The `PlayerCircle` component now accepts an `isBoosterTarget` prop and displays a distinct visual highlight (a pulsing green ring) on the targeted player, providing excellent visual feedback.

## 4. Conclusion

**Status:** âœ… **Fully Functional & Compliant**

The Fantasy Game module is now fully compliant with the v1.4 specifications. The scoring logic is more refined, the booster system is smarter, and critical validation rules are now enforced, preventing invalid data states. The implementation is robust and aligns perfectly with the documented requirements.
