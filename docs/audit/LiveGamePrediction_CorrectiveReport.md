# Corrective Implementation Report: Live Game (Prediction Mode)

**Date:** 2025-07-31

This document summarizes the corrective actions taken to complete and stabilize the Live Game (Prediction Mode) based on the initial audit findings.

---

### ‚úÖ 1. What Was Added

- **Dynamic Bonus Questions:** The `generateBonusQuestions` function was expanded to produce a set of 4 contextual questions based on the predicted score pattern (0-0, low-scoring, high-scoring).
- **Tie-Breaking Logic:** The leaderboard sorting logic was updated to use a multi-level tie-breaking system:
  1.  `total_points` (descending)
  2.  `goal_diff_error` (ascending)
  3.  `submission_time` (ascending)
- **API Adapter Module:** A new file `src/lib/apiAdapter.ts` was created. It contains placeholder functions (`fetchLiveOdds`, `fetchFixtureStatus`) to facilitate a smooth transition from mock data to a real API in the future.
- **"Celebrate Winners" Button:** The button was added to the `LiveGameResultsPage.tsx`, allowing league admins to create a celebration post in the league feed.

### üîÑ 2. What Was Refactored

- **Live Refresh Mechanism:** The score calculation logic was moved from the component's render cycle into a centralized `tick` action in the `useMockStore`. This action now runs every 15 seconds for ongoing matches, recalculating all player scores and persisting them in the state. The UI now reactively displays these pre-calculated scores, improving performance and consistency.
- **Score Persistence:** Player scores (`total_points`, `score_final`, etc.) are now explicitly calculated and stored within the player entry object in the store during the `tick` process, preventing redundant calculations on every render.
- **Halftime Edit State:** The `midtime_edit` button is now correctly disabled after a single use.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 3. Known Limitations (Until Full API Integration)

- **Live Data is Simulated:** The "live" match progress (minute, score changes) is based on a simple timer and predefined events in the mock store, not real match data.
- **Bonus Question Answers:** The "correct" answers for bonus questions are currently hardcoded in the mock data. A real implementation will require a service to determine the actual outcomes (e.g., who had more possession, who scored first).
- **API Adapter is a Placeholder:** The functions in `apiAdapter.ts` currently return mock data and do not make real network requests. A `USE_REAL_API` flag is in place to control this behavior for future development.

### Conclusion

The Live Game (Prediction Mode) is now functionally complete according to the MVP specifications. The system correctly generates 4 bonus questions, applies a robust scoring and tie-breaking logic, and features a lightweight live refresh. The architecture has been refactored to be more performant and is prepared for future integration with live data APIs.
