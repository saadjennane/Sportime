# Audit Report: Paid Private Tournaments v3

**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Auditor:** Dualite Alpha

This report covers the full implementation of the Paid Private Tournaments feature, including core mechanics (Phase 1) and UX/copywriting (Phase 2).

---

### 1. Game Creation Wizard

- ✅ **`Step6_PrizePool.tsx`**: The "Add a Prize Pool" toggle correctly appears and activates the configuration panel.
- ✅ **`Step6_PrizePool.tsx`**: Entry fee input is correctly clamped between 1 and 10.
- ✅ **`Step6_PrizePool.tsx`**: Player count is correctly sourced from the wizard's state.
- ✅ **`Step6_PrizePool.tsx`**: Prize pool, Sportime fee, and prize distribution calculations are all correctly implemented as per the formula.
- ✅ **`Step6_PrizePool.tsx`**: The prize preview, reward tier, and coin bonus previews all update dynamically and correctly when the entry fee is changed.
- ✅ **`Step6_PrizePool.tsx`**: All currency values are correctly rounded to 2 decimal places using `.toFixed(2)`.

### 2. Reward Logic

- ✅ **`Step6_PrizePool.tsx`**: `getInAppRewards()` function correctly returns the tier based on the entry fee.
- ✅ **`Step6_PrizePool.tsx`**: `getParticipationCoins()` function correctly returns the bonus coins based on the entry fee.
- ❌ **`useMockStore.ts`**: **Missing.** The core `distributePrizes` function is not implemented. There is no logic to handle the end-of-game reward distribution.
- ❌ **`useMockStore.ts`**: **Missing.** Logic to award participation coins to all players who complete the tournament is not present.
- ❌ **`useMockStore.ts`**: **Missing.** No calls to update user inventories (e.g., `addTicket`) are made, as the distribution logic is absent.

### 3. Admin Limits

- ✅ **`types/index.ts` & `data/mockUsers.ts`**: The `Profile` type and mock data correctly include `paidTournamentsCreatedThisMonth` and `activePaidTournaments`.
- ✅ **`useMockStore.ts`**: The `createPrivateLeagueGame` function correctly checks for the 5/month and 2 active tournament limits.
- ✅ **`CreatePrivateLeagueWizard.tsx`**: The `AdminLimitModal` is correctly triggered if the creation is blocked by the store logic.
- ✅ **`useMockStore.ts`**: The limit check is correctly implemented in the store, preventing bypass from the UI.

### 4. Join Game Modal

- ✅ **`JoinPaidTournamentModal.tsx`**: The modal correctly displays the entry fee and descriptive text.
- ✅ **`JoinPaidTournamentModal.tsx`**: A mock payment flow with loading and confirmation states is implemented.
- ✅ **`JoinPaidTournamentModal.tsx`**: A success message and confirmation view appear after the mock payment.
- ✅ **`App.tsx`**: The modal's state is managed correctly, ensuring it resets cleanly on close.

### 5. End-of-Game Flow

- ✅ **`PaidTournamentResultsModal.tsx`**: The component correctly supports 'winner' and 'participant' variants.
- ✅ **`PaidTournamentResultsModal.tsx`**: The component is set up to receive dynamic data (`rank`, `prize`, `bonusCoins`).
- ✅ **`PaidTournamentResultsModal.tsx`**: The confetti animation for winners is implemented.
- ❌ **`useMockStore.ts`**: **Missing.** The `sendGiftCardMock` function or any placeholder for it is not called, as the end-of-game distribution logic is missing.

### 6. Visual & UX Consistency

- ✅ **All Components**: All specified copywriting, tooltips, and hint texts have been correctly implemented.
- ✅ **All Components**: The UI adheres to the Sportime design system, including emojis, colors, and button styles.
- ✅ **All Components**: Layouts are responsive and function correctly on different screen sizes.

### 7. Backend Consistency (Mock)

- ✅ **`types/index.ts`**: The `PrivateLeagueGameConfig` type correctly includes `isPaid` and `entryFee`.
- ✅ **`useMockStore.ts`**: The Zustand store acts as a consistent single source of truth for the mock environment.

### 8. Security & Edge Cases

- ✅ **`Step6_PrizePool.tsx`**: The entry fee input is correctly validated and limited.
- ✅ **`CreatePrivateLeagueWizard.tsx`**: The wizard flow ensures a player count is selected before the prize pool step, preventing calculation errors.
- ✅ **`useMockStore.ts`**: Admin limits are enforced at the store level.
- ⚠️ **`Step6_PrizePool.tsx`**: While there's a live preview, there are no explicit validation error messages in this step. This is acceptable as the inputs are controlled.

### Summary & Recommendations

The setup and configuration phase of the Paid Private Tournaments feature is **Fully Functional** and well-implemented. The UI, UX, and admin-facing wizard behave exactly as specified.

However, the post-game logic is **Missing**. The most critical next step is to implement the `distributePrizes` function that should be triggered at the end of a tournament. This function must handle:
1.  Calculating final rankings.
2.  Distributing cash prizes (mocked as gift cards).
3.  Awarding the correct in-app rewards (Tickets, Spins) based on the `rewardTier`.
4.  Awarding the `participationBonus` coins to all eligible players.
