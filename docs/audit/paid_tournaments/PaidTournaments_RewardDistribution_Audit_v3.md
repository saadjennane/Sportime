# Audit Report: Paid Private Tournaments v3 – Phase 3
- **Date:** October 20, 2025
- **Auditor:** Dualite Alpha
- **Conclusion:** ⚠️ **Partially Functional**

The reward distribution system has a functional UI flow for the end-of-game modal, but the core `distributePrizes()` logic is missing from the store. The specified implementation has several gaps, including missing logs, potential runtime errors, and unsafe state mutation patterns.

---

### 1️⃣ Function: `distributePrizes()`

- ✅ **Function Signature**: The function signature specified in the prompt is correct.
- ❌ **Implementation Status**: **Missing**. The `distributePrizes` function is not present in `src/store/useMockStore.ts`. The audit below is based on the code provided in the prompt.
- ✅ **Prize Calculation**: The prize pool split (55/30/15) is calculated correctly.
- ✅ **Rounding**: `.toFixed(2)` is used correctly for gift card amounts.
- ⚠️ **Reward Tier Logic**: The function correctly uses the `rewardTier` parameter, but it will throw a runtime error if an invalid tier is passed (e.g., `rewards[rewardTier]` would be undefined). There is no fallback or validation.
- ✅ **Participation Bonus**: The logic correctly adds the `participationBonus` to all players in the provided list.
- ✅ **Winner Rewards**: The logic correctly assigns tickets, spins, and gift cards based on rank.
- ✅ **`giftCards` Object Structure**: The structure `{ amount, provider, status }` is correctly implemented.
- ❌ **Console Logs**: The required `[Sportime] Rewards distributed...` log is missing from the function's implementation.

### 2️⃣ Gift Card Mock

- ❌ **Function Existence**: The `sendGiftCardMock()` function is specified but is **missing** from the implementation.
- ❌ **Invocation**: The function is not called within `distributePrizes()`.

### 3️⃣ UI / End-of-Game Modal (`PaidTournamentResultsModal.tsx`)

- ✅ **Trigger Logic**: The `useEffect` hook correctly calls `distributePrizes` from the store when the modal opens.
- ✅ **Loading State**: The modal correctly displays a "Distributing Rewards..." loading state.
- ✅ **Success State**: The modal correctly transitions to a "Rewards Distributed!" success state.
- ⚠️ **UI Reward Display**: The modal does not show the specific rewards the user has won, only a generic success message.
- ❌ **Confetti Animation**: The specified confetti animation for winners is missing.

### 4️⃣ Store & Persistence

- ✅ **State Update Logic**: The logic correctly identifies the fields to update (`coins`, `tickets`, `spins`, `giftCards`).
- ⚠️ **Immutability Warning**: The provided `distributePrizes` code mutates the user object from `get()` directly (e.g., `user.coins += ...`). This is not a safe pattern for Zustand and can lead to unpredictable UI behavior. State updates should be immutable.
- ⚠️ **Persistence**: State is in-memory and does not persist on page reload. This is expected for a mock store but should be noted for future backend integration.

### 5️⃣ Edge Cases & Validation

- ✅ **Player Count**: The logic gracefully handles tournaments with fewer than 3 players.
- ❌ **Invalid `rewardTier`**: The code will throw a runtime error if an invalid `rewardTier` is passed.
- ✅ **Reward Stacking**: The `PaidTournamentResultsModal.tsx` component uses a `distributed` state flag, correctly preventing `distributePrizes` from being called multiple times.
- ✅ **NaN/undefined values**: Prize calculations appear robust against `NaN` or `undefined` values.
- ✅ **Non-participants**: The logic correctly rewards only the players passed into the function.
