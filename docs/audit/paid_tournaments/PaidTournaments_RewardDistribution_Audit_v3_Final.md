# Audit Report – Paid Private Tournaments v3 (Phase 3)

**Date:** October 20, 2025
**Auditor:** Dualite Alpha
**Objective:** Validate the implementation of the `distributePrizes()` function and the end-to-end reward distribution flow for Paid Private Tournaments.

---

### 1. Function: `distributePrizes()`

- **✅ Function Existence:** ❌ **Error.** The function `distributePrizes()` is not implemented in `src/store/useMockStore.ts`. The UI calls it, but the logic is missing.
- **✅ Parameters:** ❌ **Error.** Function signature cannot be verified as it does not exist.
- **✅ Reward Tier Validation:** ❌ **Error.** Logic is missing.
- **✅ Prize Calculation:** ❌ **Error.** Logic is missing.
- **✅ Immutability:** ❌ **Error.** Logic is missing.
- **✅ Reward Attribution:** ❌ **Error.** Logic is missing.
- **✅ Participation Bonus:** ❌ **Error.** Logic is missing.
- **✅ Console Logs:** ❌ **Error.** Logic is missing.

### 2. `sendGiftCardMock()`

- **✅ Function Existence:** ❌ **Error.** The function `sendGiftCardMock()` is not implemented in `src/store/useMockStore.ts`.
- **✅ Logs:** ❌ **Error.** Logic is missing.
- **✅ Trigger:** ❌ **Error.** Logic is missing.
- **✅ No Duplicates:** ❌ **Error.** Logic is missing.

### 3. UI Validation – `PaidTournamentResultsModal.tsx`

- **✅ Modal Triggers Distribution:** ✅ **Passed.** The modal correctly attempts to call `distributePrizes()` from the store within a `useEffect` hook.
- **✅ Loading → Success Transition:** ✅ **Passed.** The component correctly uses `loading` and `distributed` states to manage its UI.
- **✅ Text Changes:** ✅ **Passed.** The UI correctly displays "Distributing Rewards..." and "Rewards successfully delivered!" based on its internal state.
- **✅ Confetti Animation:** ⚠️ **Warning.** No confetti animation is implemented for winners. This is a minor UI polish issue.
- **✅ No Re-trigger:** ✅ **Passed.** The `distributed` flag correctly prevents the `distributePrizes` function from being called multiple times.

---

### 4. Store & Persistence

- **✅ Store State Update:** ❌ **Error.** No state is updated because the core function is missing. The `coins`, `tickets`, and `giftCards` arrays in the user profile are not modified.
- **✅ `addSpins` Action:** ❌ **Error.** The required `addSpins` action is missing from `src/store/useSpinStore.ts`.
- **✅ No NaN Values:** N/A.
- **✅ Users Untouched:** N/A.
- **✅ Double Trigger Prevention (Store):** ❌ **Error.** No guard exists at the store level.

---

### 5. Edge Cases & Validation

- **✅ < 3 Players:** ❌ **Error.** Logic is missing.
- **✅ Invalid `rewardTier`:** ❌ **Error.** Logic is missing.
- **✅ Missing `players`:** ❌ **Error.** Logic is missing.

---

### Conclusion: Not Functional

The reward distribution system is **not functional**. While the UI component `PaidTournamentResultsModal` is correctly implemented to trigger the flow, the entire backend mock logic within `useMockStore.ts` is absent. The `distributePrizes` and `sendGiftCardMock` functions were never added to the store, making the feature incomplete.

**Next Step:** The immediate next step must be to **implement the missing `distributePrizes` function** in `useMockStore.ts` as specified in the previous prompt, and add the `addSpins` action to `useSpinStore.ts`.
