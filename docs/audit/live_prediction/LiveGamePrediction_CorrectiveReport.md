# Corrective Implementation Report: Live Game (Prediction Mode)

**Date:** July 31, 2025
**Author:** Dualite Alpha

This document summarizes the corrective actions taken to align the "Live Game (Prediction Mode)" with its MVP specifications, following the audit of July 30, 2025.

### 1. What Was Added

-   **Dynamic 4-Question Bonus System:**
    -   The `generateBonusQuestions` function in `useMockStore.ts` has been expanded to produce a full set of four contextual questions based on the predicted score pattern (0-0, low-scoring, high-scoring).
    -   Each question is now correctly valued at 10 points.

-   **Tie-Breaking Logic:**
    -   The leaderboard sorting mechanism has been updated to incorporate the specified tie-breaking rules. The order is now:
        1.  Total Points (descending)
        2.  Goal Difference Error (ascending)
        3.  Submission Time (ascending)

-   **Live Refresh Mechanism:**
    -   A `tick` action has been added to `useMockStore.ts`. This function now serves as the game's heartbeat.
    -   On the `LiveGamePlayPage.tsx`, a `setInterval` timer calls this `tick` action every 15 seconds, which recalculates all player scores and updates the game state. This simulates a live environment.

-   **API Adapter for Future Integration:**
    -   A new file, `src/lib/apiAdapter.ts`, has been created.
    -   It contains placeholder functions (`fetchLiveOdds`, `fetchFixtureStatus`) and a `USE_REAL_API` flag. This architecture prepares the system for a future transition from mock data to a live API.

-   **"Celebrate Winners" Button:**
    -   The "Celebrate Winners" button has been added to the `LiveGameResultsPage.tsx` for league admins, enabling them to create a snapshot and post it to the league feed.

### 2. What Was Refactored

-   **Score Calculation & Persistence:**
    -   Score calculation is no longer performed on every render. Instead, the new `tick` function calculates scores periodically and persists them directly into the Zustand store. The UI now reactively displays these pre-calculated scores, improving performance and consistency.

-   **Halftime Edit State:**
    -   The logic has been updated to ensure the halftime edit button is correctly disabled after a single use.

### 3. Known Limitations (Until Full API Integration)

-   **Mock Data Dependency:** The entire system still runs on a mock data simulation. The `tick` function simulates match progress (minute increments, score changes) rather than fetching it from a live source.
-   **Manual Triggers:** Match status changes (e.g., from "Ongoing" to "Finished") are not automatic and must be managed within the mock data.
-   **Static Odds:** The odds for bonus questions and other events are static and do not change in real-time.

### Conclusion

The "Live Game (Prediction Mode)" is now functionally complete according to the MVP specifications. The bonus questions system, tie-breaking, and live updates are all implemented. The architecture has been improved for performance and is now prepared for future integration with a live data API.
