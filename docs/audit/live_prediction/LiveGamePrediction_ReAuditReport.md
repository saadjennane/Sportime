# Re-Audit Report: Live Game (Prediction Mode)

**Date:** July 31, 2025
**Auditor:** Dualite Alpha
**Objective:** Verify the implementation of corrective fixes for the "Live Game (Prediction Mode)" and check for remaining discrepancies.

---

### Summary of Detected Logic

The system has been significantly updated. A `tick` function in the `useMockStore` now drives the game's live state, recalculating scores every 15 seconds. The `LiveGamePlayPage` uses this to display live updates. The `generateBonusQuestions` function is now more complex, and the leaderboard sorting logic has been updated.

### 1. Bonus Questions Logic

-   **Number of Questions:** The `generateBonusQuestions` function in `useMockStore.ts` now correctly generates an array of **four** distinct questions based on the predicted score pattern.
-   **Point Value:** The `calculateLiveGameScores` function in `liveGameEngine.ts` iterates through the `bonus_answers` array and awards **10 points** for each correct answer.
-   **Contextual Templates:** The question sets are correctly differentiated for `0-0`, `low-scoring`, and `high-scoring` predictions.
-   **Total Points:** The total bonus points are correctly capped at 40 (4 questions Ã— 10 points).

**Verdict:** The bonus questions system is now **fully functional** and matches the specification.

### 2. Scoring Structure

-   The core scoring formula for `ScoreFinal` (Result, GD, Team Accuracy, Exact Score) remains correct.
-   The halftime edit malus of -40% (x0.6 multiplier) is correctly applied to the `ScoreFinal` portion of the score.

**Verdict:** The scoring structure is **correct**.

### 3. Tie-Breaking

-   The leaderboard sorting logic in `LiveGamePlayPage.tsx` and `LiveGameResultsPage.tsx` has been updated.
-   It now correctly sorts players based on the specified criteria:
    1.  `total_points` (descending)
    2.  `goal_diff_error` (ascending)
    3.  `submitted_at` (ascending)

**Verdict:** The tie-breaking logic is **correctly implemented**.

### 4. Live Refresh

-   The `LiveGamePlayPage.tsx` now contains a `useEffect` hook with a `setInterval` that calls the `onTick` prop (which triggers `tickLiveGame` in the store) every 15 seconds.
-   This interval is correctly cleared when the component unmounts or the game status is no longer "Ongoing".

**Verdict:** The live refresh mechanism is **correctly implemented**.

### 5. Discrepancies vs. Intended Logic

-   **Initial Discrepancy (Single Bonus Question):** The previous major discrepancy, where only one bonus question worth 40 points was generated, has been **resolved**. The frontend now correctly renders the four questions generated by the centralized store logic.

### Conclusion

**Status: Fully Functional**

The "Live Game (Prediction Mode)" now fully aligns with the specified corrective requirements. All previously identified discrepancies have been addressed. The bonus questions system, tie-breaking, and live refresh mechanisms are implemented and working as intended within the mock data environment.
